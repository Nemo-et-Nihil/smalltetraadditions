# smalltetraadditions
Adds tetra support to a few mods, currently supports Aquaculture, Cataclysm, Enigmatic legacy,
Majrusz's Progressive Difficulty, and Spelunkery. It also adds a socket for all gems tagged as sapphires by forge,
and tags dragon bones for the latest 1.20.1 beta 2 of Ice and Fire so that tetracelium accepts them as a material.
